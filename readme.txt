These are just a few of the things this plugin can do so just go on and try it for yourself!

The plugin can be used to display your fresh content on your homepage, display related posts on single post pages, put special offers into sliders to create attention and any other way you see fit. 

== Installation ==

**Before updating, make sure you back-up all your custom made themes.**

Version 3.0 is a complete plugin rewrite. Previous slider themes won't be compatible by default with this version. You will be able to choose the previous themes but they will issue PHP errors when used.

Sliders created with Featured Articles 2.X will be converted to current version automatically when activating Featured Articles Lite 3.0.

Now, here are the update instructions (automatic update will also work):

If you are upgrading to the current version, make sure you backup all the files of the previous installation. After you backup, make sure that under plugin Setting page, the option to completely unistall the plugin (including content) is unchecked since version 3.X will automatically convert your existing sliders to current version when activating.

Next, either update version 3.X from WordPress admin page Plugins or by FTP. If updatng by FTP, make sure that you first remove the previous plugin version completely before uploading version 3.X.

For any clarifications ask for help on our [Forums] (http://www.codeflavors.com/codeflavors-forums/forum/featured-articles-3-0/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=fa_lite "Featured Articles 3 Forums").
We don't actively monitor the forum here on Wordpres.org so responses to questions posted here might take a while to get answered.

== Changelog ==

Previous slider themes from version 2.X.X are not compatible with Featured Articles 3.0.

**Please note**, if you modified or created new slider themes, you should set up a slider themes folder outside the plugin folder to avoid having your modifications overwritten.
The process of moving the slider themes folder from within the plugin folder is described here: [How to move slider themes folder](http://www.codeflavors.com/documentation/featured-articles-pro-3/moving-slider-themes-folder/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=fa_lite "Move Featured Articles WP slider themes outside the plugin folder").

The only thing it needs is for the image to have the width and height attributes set in HTML.

= 2.0 =
Initial release for the new redesigned Wordpress Featured Articles

== Troubleshooting ==

Plugin is guaranteed to work on a clean WordPress install. Since themes and other plugins don't always play nice, there are a few things you could check if sliders won't work in your pages:

1. Check that only one jquery file is loaded. Most times, a manually loaded jQuery version in theme header or by a plugin may be the cause. Look in your page source in browser and see if that's the problem.
2. Plugins merging JavaScript and CSS files may also cause problems. In this case, it's all about god intentions with bad results.
3. Use the proper Wordpress version (4 +).
4. See if your theme footer.php file calls wp_footer().

If all options are exhausted, you can always ask for help on our forums at [CodeFlavors Featured Articles WP forum](http://www.codeflavors.com/codeflavors-forums/forum/featured-articles-3-0/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=fa_lite "Featured Articles 3 for WordPress forum").
